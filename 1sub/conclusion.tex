\section{CONCLUSION}
This paper presents Maat, an efficient Layer-4 load balancer for data center networks. By proposing a new scheduling method called the power of one random choice, Maat does not compromise fairness to maintain PCC as hash-based load balancers do. Moreover, Maat does not need to modify the existing protocol stack or introduce more advanced schedule mechanisms to improve fairness. Maat also introduces CBF to distinguish which traffic is forwarded to hash-selected servers and which traffic is forwarded to randomly selected servers, resolving potential PCC violations. We implemented Maat on both a software prototype and a programmable ASIC Tofino switch. The evaluation results show that compared with other existing L4 LBs, Maat can fully maintain PCC at cost of negligible memory overhead and significantly improve fairness.
